  <h3>Throughout my life, there have been many experiences I have had. 
      For example, the experience of working in a small supermarket, being a dropship to supplement income while studying, 
      being one of the committee members at UiTM, helping students in college and so on. 
      However, there are many more experiences that I have and I will never forget every time I experience them.</h3>

<p class="a" style="color:rgb(31, 16, 71);"><b>I started being a dropship selling scarves in July 2020. I am being a small entrepreneur 
  because I wanted to increase my income while I was studying. My dropship business name is Lelescarves. As we all know, since the Covid-19 
  pandemic occurred, many have been affected in terms of income, learning and so on. So, I took a step for myself to work while studying 
  even just working online.</b></p>

<p class="b" style="color:rgb(94, 10, 73);"><b>At first, I felt unsure to sell because I was worried about no demand from customers, 
  but after getting motivation and advice from the founders, I felt more motivated to do business. This is because I really love business 
  because my ambition one day is want to be a famous entrepreneur. After that, i get a lot of requests from customers to buy scarves direct 
  from me. This is because customers are starting to trust me. I get incredible commissions and this gives more motivation for me to dabble 
  in the business world.</b></p>

<p class="c" style="color:rgb(66, 11, 11);"><b>When I had just graduated from high school, I started looking for part-time work in several 
  shops near home. After that, I got a chance to work in a small supermarket and I became one of the cashiers there. It was my experience 
  working physically and it was a very good experience for me because I was able to get to know different types of people and get to know the 
  meaning of life. Unfortunately, all the pictures taken to be used as memories have been lost.</b></p>

  I ventured into this position is because i want to lead and help students towards their welfare in college. I am the Exco of 'Economic & 
  Entrepreneurship' and I want to help students so that they can venture into entrepreneurship and learn how to increase their income 
  while in college. I am very happy to see many of the students venture into business and learn how to live independently.</b></p>

<p class="a" style="color:rgb(66, 11, 11);"><b>I have gained a lot of experience since venturing into this field of leadership. 
  Among them, my colleagues and I were on duty during the enrollment of students returning to college in phases. In addition, there are 
  many programs organized by each college and I get experience of different positions such as assistant program head, program secretary, 
  exco of food, exco of multimedia and publicity, exco of protocol and safety, exco of invitation and technical, and exco of registration. 
  Each of these different positions gave me the confidence to venture into new experiences and be in new positions.</b></p>

<p class="a" style="color:rgb(31, 16, 71);"><b>The experience of being a member in this field of leadership I will never forget as it had 
  a huge impact in my life as one of the leaders to the surrounding community. After I graduate from college, I will pursue this field of 
  leadership in the future. Leadership refers to the ability to take on the role of influencing others toward goodness. A leader needs to 
  have a personality that is able to influence others as well as willing to be reprimanded or criticized by others. It is very important for 
  us to venture into this field of leadership because we can learn self-discipline as well as learn a way of life with integrity.</b></p>
